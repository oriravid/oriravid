Hi, I’m Ori! I’m a software engineer with an extensive audio engineering background.

My skillset in software engineering has primarily been focused on frontend development via React, JavaScript, CSS3, and HTML5, though I am always happy to dive into the backend of a project and work on organized, efficient data flow.

In conjunction, I’ve logged countless hours in both large-scale recording facilities and small project studios, polishing my knowledge in audio recording, editing, and processing in the analog/digital domains.

My experience in these two fields has fueled my passion to take part in media related projects that strive for excellence in design, UX/UI, and functionality.
